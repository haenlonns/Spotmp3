# Spotmp3
Uses Spotify API to download playlists as .mp3

Open source project, so feel free to fork/clone as needed, although credit would make me very happy :)
Have not added dependencies in yet, but the libraries used are:
- yt_dlp
- youtubesearchpython
- spotipy

To run the file, download the Python files and dependencies, and edit the spotipy.oauth2 so that it includes your client code, client secret,
and redirect URI (for now, you will have to create your own Spotify application at https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/)
